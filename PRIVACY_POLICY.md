## QuickLeaf: Privacy policy

QuickLeaf is designed to remotely control the key features of the Nissan Leaf in the most robust, easiest and fastest way. This is achieved by providing a very simple interface without unnecessary navigation, automatically retry if something fails, and run in the background.

You can log into the app with your You+Nissan account, just like in the Nissanconnect app

Limitations
-----------

The app communicates with the car via Nissan's servers. Possible functionality is therefore limited to what their API can offer. Functions can also suddenly stop working because they are removed or modified in the API.

In addition, there is nothing to do with the time it takes to contact the car or that the car is completely inaccessible. Such problems are often caused by poor/no coverage or slow response by Nissan\\'s servers. But the app makes sure to make the experience of this the best possible and least disturbing.

Data storage
------------

Passwords are securely encrypted via the Android KeyStore API and stored in the app upon login, so that the app can automatically log in again when the API requires it. Anonymous data on errors and statistics is sent to Google Firebase, to help troubleshoot and improve the app. In addition, Nissan will probably also save some data on its servers.

Free app
--------

The app is free, but any contributions are greatly appreciated. This can be done from within this app if you like it. Only you know what the app is worth to you, so this is up to you.

Anyway, I appreciate everyone who tries the app and gives feedback if something doesn't work properly. This can be sent to [quickleaf.feedback@gmail.com](mailto:quickleaf.feedback@gmail.com)

If you like the app and it works fine for you, I will be very happy if you give it a good rating on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.joymyr.quickleaf)
